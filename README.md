# PermissionedWhitelistSolidity

This project can be used to store, read and modify multiple whitelists with separate permissions

## ToDo

For now the lists are stored entirely on-chain and can only be modified by specified users called 'admins'.
In the future once UI is created whitelists should be stored on IPFS and only merkle tree root are gonna be uploaded on-chain.
Then participation of specific user on selected whitelists can be confirmed using merkle tree proofs.
